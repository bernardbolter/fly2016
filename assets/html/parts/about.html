    <p>My name is Aaron Kahn I'm the sole proprietor of FlyIt4U. I was born and raised in San Francisco. I attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona and graduated in 1996, after which I began a professional pilot career.</p>
    <p>I started FlyIt4U in 2005 because I was looking for a new pilot challenge that would supplement my then non-flying business. I continue to do it to this day because I enjoy the challenges, I like to travel, and it's satisfying to get the job done safely. Even after a decade of delivery flights I still get excited when planning a new trip!</p>
