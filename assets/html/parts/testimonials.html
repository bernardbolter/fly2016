			<p>"I recently used FlyIt4U to ferry my Piper Arrow. They were a pleasure to deal with, prompt, professional and willing to accommodate my plans. Even with a border crossing in the middle of the flight they made every effort to keep costs down and get the airplane here on schedule. We were in constant contact throughout the flight and I always knew where they were. They even helped with Customs and provided a detailed report on how the airplane performed relative to book numbers for cruise and fuel burn. A top notch service, I would recommend FlyIt4U to anyone."</p>
