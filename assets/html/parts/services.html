				<h2>Ferry Flight</h2>
				<p>Experience counts. As Pilot-In-Command of FlyIt4U delivery flights, I have flown 58,000 miles, landed in 38 states, and crossed the Continental Divide 29 times.  Internationally, I've flown in Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, and over the North Atlantic to Denmark.  Put your airplane in my capable hands, and you get a 24-year pilot who has has time in dozens of different airplane types. I can either ferry your airplane alone; fly with you as a flight instructor; or consult with you if you require expertise only.</p>
