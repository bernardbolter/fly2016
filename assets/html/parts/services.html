				<h2>Ferry Flight</h2>
				<p>Experience counts. As Pilot-In-Command of FlyIt4U delivery flights, I have flown 58,000 miles, landed in 38 states, and crossed the Continental Divide 29 times.  Internationally, I've flown in Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, and over the North Atlantic to Denmark.  Put your airplane in my capable hands, and you get a 24-year pilot who has has time in dozens of different airplane types. I can either ferry your airplane alone; fly with you as a flight instructor; or consult with you if you require expertise only.</p>

				<h2>Container Shipping</h2>
				<p>If you prefer, or your circumstances dictate, FlyIt4U can make arrangements for your aircraft to be shipped. This usually involves dismantling and container-izing the aircraft. The reverse is performed at a destination of your choice. Some or all of the process can be handled professionally and expeditiously for you.  Advantages of shipping your aircraft include low risk and unlimited destinations.</p>
